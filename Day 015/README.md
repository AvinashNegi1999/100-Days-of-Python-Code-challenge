## 📅 Day 15 - Coffee Machine Program

### 🔧 Concepts I Practised:

* Dictionaries with nested values (`MENU`, `resources`)
* Functions and conditionals
* Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
* `while` loops and control flow
* Handling user input
* Simple project structure with modular functions

### 🛠️ What I Built:

A **Coffee Machine Simulator** that:

* Takes user orders (`espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`)
* Checks if ingredients are sufficient
* Processes coins and returns change
* Deducts used resources and prints status
* Supports commands: `report` to print current resources, `off` to shut down the machine

### ☕ Sample Features:

* Modular code with `check_resources()`, `money()`, `make_coffee()`
* Realistic coin inputs: quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies
* Resource tracking and updates after every order
